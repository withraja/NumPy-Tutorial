# NumPy Library

NumPy stands for *Numerical Python* and provides support for arrays, which are multi-dimensional structures for storing data.  

Think of it as a more efficient way to store and perform mathematical operations on large amounts of numerical data. With NumPy, you can perform calculations on an entire array, rather than one value at a time, which makes it faster and more convenient to work with large datasets.  

It is a foundation library for many other scientific computing and data analysis libraries in Python, including Pandas.
